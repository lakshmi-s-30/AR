# AR Watch Try-On Application

The world is rapidly changing, and the online shopping mechanism has further helped people to keep pace with changes happening. E-Shopping facilitates people in saving their time but tends to put the buyers in dilemma regarding the colour, texture, material, size, etc. The major hindrance comes when purchases are made by viewing a 2-D image of the goods, and after delivery we often find it inapt. We can tackle this problem by integrating Augmented Reality technology in e-shopping. Augmented reality provides a way to integrate various virtual entities with real world objects. This project presents an AR application which aims to provide a real time shopping experience for online watch buyers. The AR implementation allows the user to have a preview of the watch on his/her wrist using their mobile devices, which demonstrates the product's physical size and also the style fit. This would help double the sales and would be even more feasible for the sellers with reduced efforts on return work and more focus on watch production. The tools used are Unity, Vuforia and Blender for achieving our goals.
